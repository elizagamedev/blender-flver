Fromsoft FLVER Plugin for Blender
=================================

This is a plugin for importing Fromsoft FLVER files from games such as *Dark
Souls*, *Bloodborne*, and *Sekiro* into Blender. It supports importing
geometry, (untextured) materials, and armature data. It has been tested on a
very limited selection of actual files (specifically from *Dark Souls* and
*Dark Souls: Remastered*), so some tweaking may be required. The code for
interpreting the FLVER files was heavily based on
[SoulsFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats).
